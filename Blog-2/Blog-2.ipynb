    "In 2014, Fernando Pérez announced a spin-off project from IPython called Project Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter’s name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python, and R, and also an homage to Galileo’s notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is language agnostic and it supports execution environments (means kernels) in several dozen languages among which are Python, Julia, R, Haskell, Ruby, and others.\n",

    "### **Q2. What is a Jupyter Notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "![img3](ML_pics/Blog_img3.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is a web-based data science tool that provides an interactive computational environment for writing code or creating documents. The term “notebook” is closely related to entities like Jupyter web application and Jupyter Python web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook document is a JSON document, and containing an ordered list of input/output cells that can contain code, text (using Markdown), mathematics, plots, and rich media, usually ending with the “.ipynb” extension. It was formerly known as IPython Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook can be converted to several pen standard output formats (HTML, presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown, Python) through “Download As” in the web interface, via the nbconvert library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other products**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook has become a popular user interface and there are some other products as well like:\n",
    "\n",
    "**JupyterHub**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a multi-user server for Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "**JupyterLab**\n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer working on JupyterLab as it offers all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colaboratory**\n",
    "\n",
    "Colaboratory (also known as Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud and stores its notebooks on Google Drive. Colab only supports the Python 2 and Python 3 kernels and does not support the other Jupyter kernels Julia and R."
