    "Some time back, I came across a .py file while working on one of the projects in an IT firm. Being a software engineer, this new file extension and python logo truly fascinated me and straight away I eagerly started exploring the code written in it. As a newbie at that time, some terms of the code like naive Bayes, cross-validation, and others were unfamiliar to me. That typical day and many subsequent days, I meticulously kept researching around these terms and in no considerable time, I set a target for myself to be a Machine Learning Engineer.\n",

    "For example, imagine if you have been provided with 10,000 credit card transactions and asked to find out fraudulent ones then how much time will it take to do it manually? Imagine if every minute 100 transactions are happening then how much human effort will be required to trace fraud transactions; also think in terms of loss for both customer and credit card firm. There can be numerous examples similar to this. \n",
